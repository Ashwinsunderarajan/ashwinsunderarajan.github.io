            <h3>Speed bump</h3>
            <p>Speed bumps (or traffic thresholds or 
               speed breakers) are the common name for 
               a family of traffic calming devices that
               use vertical deflection to slow 
               motor-vehicle traffic in order to 
               improve safety conditions. Variations 
               include the speed hump, speed cushion,
              and speed table.</p>

            <h3>t-insertion</h3>
            <p>T intersection. One of the intersection 
              traffic signs. The road you are traveling 
              on ends straight ahead. Slow down and 
              prepare to stop before turning.</p>

            <h3>y-intersection</h3>
            <p>Y intersection. One of the intersection traffic signs. 
              There is a three-way intersection up ahead on 
              the road, with all roads being of equal size 
              and importance. Other warning signs</p>

            <h3>merge</h3>
            <p>The merging traffic sign will typically 
              indicate which lane should be merging 
              into the other. Drivers on the main 
              highway should be aware of merging vehicles.</p>

            <img src="image/narrow-bridge.png">
            <h3>narrow-bridge</h3>
            <p>The narrow bridge sign indicates that 
              the driver is approaching a bridge that 
              is more narrow than the road they are 
              currently on. Drivers should slow down 
              while crossing narrow bridges. Avoid 
              completely stopping your vehicle on a 
              bridge.</p>

            <img src="image/slope.png">
            <h3>slop</h3>
            <p>The sign is a red triangle (as are all road warning signs) 
              with a slope going up or down, and a numerical 
              expression. If the road goes downhill, the slope
               on the sign goes down from left to right. 
               If the road goes uphill, the slope on the 
               sign goes up from left to right.</p>
